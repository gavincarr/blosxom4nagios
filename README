blosxom4nagios
--------------

blosxom4nagios is a special-purpose blosxom application (a 
bloglet!) used for capturing notifications from nagios and making 
them available via atom or rss feeds. It allows you to receive
and track nagios notifications via your RSS reader instead of
clogging up your mailbox.

See the INSTALL file for installation docs.



Usage
-----

blosxom4nagios is usually configured under the /nagios/blosxom
url namespace (or /blosxom for a dedicated nagios virtualhost).
If your server is www.example.com, then your main blosxom4nagios 
page is typically:

  http://www.example.com/nagios/blosxom/

which will give you a page showing the 100 most recent host and
service notifications you have received. You can turn any
blosxom4nagios page into a feed version by appending 'atom' or
'rss' to the page url, so feeds for that page are available at:

  http://www.example.com/nagios/blosxom/atom
  http://www.example.com/nagios/blosxom/rss

All notifications are tagged with 'host' for host notifications,
and 'service' for service notifications, so you can restrict your
view to one or the other by specifying a tag to view e.g.

  http://www.example.com/nagios/blosxom/tags/host
  http://www.example.com/nagios/blosxom/tags/service
  http://www.example.com/nagios/blosxom/tags/host/atom
  http://www.example.com/nagios/blosxom/tags/service/rss

Notifications are also tagged with all of the following that are
available: hostgroup, hostname, servicegroup, servicename, nagios
state (OK/WARNING/CRITICAL/UNKNOWN/UP/DOWN), and nagios contact,
so all of the following filter your notifications in different
ways:

  http://www.example.com/nagios/blosxom/tags/nagiosadmin
  http://www.example.com/nagios/blosxom/tags/hostgroup1
  http://www.example.com/nagios/blosxom/tags/myhost
  http://www.example.com/nagios/blosxom/tags/servicegroup2
  http://www.example.com/nagios/blosxom/tags/randomservice
  http://www.example.com/nagios/blosxom/tags/CRITICAL

Blosxom4nagios also supports year/month/date url filtering as 
well, so to see just the notifications for particular dates you 
can do queries like:

  http://www.example.com/nagios/blosxom/2008/03
  http://www.example.com/nagios/blosxom/2008/tags/nagiosadmin
  http://www.example.com/nagios/blosxom/tags/hostgroup1/2008/03
  http://www.example.com/nagios/blosxom/tags/myhost/2008/03/14
  http://www.example.com/nagios/blosxom/tags/servicegroup2/2008/03/14/atom
  http://www.example.com/nagios/blosxom/2008/tags/randomservice/rss
  http://www.example.com/nagios/blosxom/2008/03/tags/CRITICAL
