=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: absolute

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Replaces <a href="/relative/path/to/something.html"> with the fully-qualified/
absolute <a href="$blosxom::url/relative/path/to/something.html">, especially 
important for RSS feeds, since most RSS readers don't make these absolute 
themselves.

Optionally replaces <img src="/relative/path/to/image.gif"> with the 
fully-qualified/absolute <img src="$image_url/relative/path/to/image.gif">.

For those who have their $datadir publicly-available (i.e. under their
Web server's document root), also optionally adds fully-qualified/absolute
paths to images.  So mention of <img src="something.gif"> in 
/relative/path/to/something.txt will be replaced with
<img src="$datadir_url/relative/path/to/something.gif">.

The plug-in also should preserve any attributes included in the <a /> or
<img /> tags.
