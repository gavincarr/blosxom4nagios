=head1 NAME

metaclear - clear/reset the %blosxom::meta hash at the start of a story

=head1 DESCRIPTION

metaclear is a plugin to clear/reset the %blosxom::meta hash at the start
of a story. It should be used with any of the new-style meta plugins like 
L<metamail>, L<metadir>, L<metafile>, etc., and must be called B<BEFORE> 
any of those.

=head1 USAGE

Should be loaded early, before all other meta plugins e.g. as 01metaclear. 

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<metamail>, L<metadir>, L<metafile>

Blosxom: http://blosxom.sourceforge.net/

=head1 BUGS

Messing with variables in other packages is evil. This should really use 
some kind of Blosxom::Meta API instead.
