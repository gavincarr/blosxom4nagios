# For a basic atom feed, you only need set $default_author and $feed_yr.
# If you do not, the plugin will exit quietly.

# Leave blank and the atomfeed plugin will attempt to use the whoami and
# fauxami plugins

# Enclosures support
# ------------------

# You can add enclosures to your atom feed by linking to them in your post
# and giving the anchor tag a rel attribute of "enclosure".

# Set $use_full_enclosures to 1 if you wish to add length and content-type
# to your enclosures.  This function relies upon your webserver having 
# LWP modules installed.

# Name of a file to cache info about your enclosures:

# Stylesheet support
# ------------------

# If you have a stylesheet to associate with your atom feed, place it's URL here.
$css_url = "";

# You can specify the type of stylesheet here:
